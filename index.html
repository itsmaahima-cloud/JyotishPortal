                <h2>Our Tradition, Your Guide: About Acharya Shiv Tiwari</h2>
                <p>Acharya Shiv Tiwari's journey into Vedic astrology was a calling. Born into a devout Pandit family, he witnessed many people being misled and felt a strong pull to offer genuine, scripture-based guidance. Under the tutelage of his revered Guru, he earned the titles of Acharya and Shastri. His approach is not just about prediction; it's about understanding and healing.</p>
